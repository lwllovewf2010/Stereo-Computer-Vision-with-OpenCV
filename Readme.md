The purpose of this project is to learn about computer vision and 
the machine learning that goes along with it. This project is being completed using two
off the shelf webcams at VGA resolution using the openCV libaries. 

A 3D point cloud will be used to estimate, regions and edges of objects in space for use 
in an avoidance system. This project will very likely be absorbed into the Drone project.
